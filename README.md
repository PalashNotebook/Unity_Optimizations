# Unity_Optimizations

Here I will discuss & Share different Optimization techniques for Unity. This is the list as per which I will continue to discuss & share code:-

1. Generic Object-Pooling:- This is 1 of the most fundamental Optimization technique one should adopt.

2. Code-Optimization Strategies:-
  A. Remove Empty Unity Callbacks.
  B. Cache component Reference.
  C. Tag comparison technique.
  D. Use required Data structures.
  E. Avoid SendMessage & GameObject.Find.
  F. Keep common data in ScriptableObject.

3. Texture-Optimization Techniques:-
  A. Reduce unnecessary texture file size.
  B. Use Mip-maps in all required places.
  C. Use Atlas or Sprite-Packer.
  D. Adjust compression rates for non-square textures.
  E. Better to manage resolution downscale externally.
  F. Use 9-slice image for Canvas UI.

4. Physics Engine Performance Optimization.

5. Mesh & Animation Optimization Techniques.

6. Garbage Collection & Memory Management.

7. What is Batching & it's benefits.

8. Rendering Performace Improvement.

9. Best way to use Profiler & analyse performance.
